This repo includes the implementation of RotatE and pRotatE on ogbl-biokg dataset. It is based on the below repositories:

https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/KnowledgeGraphEmbedding

https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb.git

We discussed the final results in our [blog post](https://medium.com/@seshwan2/de5acf0553ac) . We had our entities and relations embedded in 1000-dimensional vectors. These vectors are representations of our entities and relations and can be used, according to our models, to make link predictions and perform graph completion tasks.
