This code includes implementation of RotatE and pRotatE on ogbl-biokg dataset. It is based on the below repositories:

https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/KnowledgeGraphEmbedding


https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb.git

We discuss in our blog post the final results of training. The final output is that we will have our entities and relations embedded in 1000-dimensional vectors. These vectors are representations of our entities and relations and can be used, according to our models, to make link predictions and perform graph completion tasks.
